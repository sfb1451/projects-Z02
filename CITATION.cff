abstract: The Animal Motor Core Facility will serve as an expert platform for the
  characterisation and quantification of animal motor and cognitive behaviour, as
  well as the assessment of the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Z02 will provide (i)
  an extensive standardised battery of behavioural tests probing motor functions in
  rodents, and (ii) systems neuroscience tools, including optogenetics and calcium
  imaging, and (iii) standardised preprocessing and data analysis. The data will be
  provided access to a shared database via the utilities provided by INF.hange of
  expertise between and across projects of the different research areas and will ensure
  adherence to good scientific practice and encourage open data access.
